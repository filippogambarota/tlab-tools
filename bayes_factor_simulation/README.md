# Bayes Factor

This repo contains some scripts to perform simple simulations for Bayes Factors in order to understand the behavior under different conditions.

* The `bf_simulation.R` script has the overall code that should be flexible enough for different scenarios. The simulation results is saved as `.rda` within the `results/` folder.
* The `bf_sim_plots.R` script loads the simulation results and perform some extra analyses and plots.
